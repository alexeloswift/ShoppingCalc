This is a discount calculator app I created.

Have you ever been out shopping and there is a really awesome sale going on? Well then, Im sure you had to whip out your phone open up your calculator and do the math. Well I made an app that does those calculations for you! All you have to do is put how much the full price of the item is, and how much of a discount there is on it and the calculator will tell you what your new total would be.
